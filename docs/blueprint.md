# **App Name**: Gymzy

## Core Features:

- Interactive Anatomy Visualization: Engage users with a fully interactive, rotatable 3D anatomical model. Muscles are color-coded based on activation frequency — from white (untrained) to deep red (frequently trained) — offering a powerful, real-time visual map of the user’s muscular development.
- Smart Workout Logging & Real-Time Muscle Feedback: Users can log exercises with sets, reps, and weights. The system automatically maps each exercise to its corresponding muscle activation using research-backed biomechanics data. The muscle diagram updates instantly, highlighting which areas were targeted — helping users train with intention and avoid neglect.
- Muscle Progress & Recovery Analytics: Track muscle-specific training volume over time with intuitive graphs and heatmaps. The system detects overuse or undertraining patterns and delivers personalized alerts — helping users maintain balanced progress, avoid injury, and optimize recovery windows.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant red (#E63946) to represent muscle engagement and energy.
- Background color: Dark gray (#262629) to make the visualizations stand out with a high-end professional feel, appropriate for athletic applications.
- Accent color: Deep red (#A23B44), a low-saturation variation of the primary color, used for subtle UI elements such as lines on the training schedule graph or borders of active elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font to provide a neutral and legible presentation.
- Use minimalist icons, monochromatic, where possible.
- The design will focus on making use of all available space on any screen.
- Add smooth transitions when highlighting muscles or switching between different views. Subtle animations when adding or completing workouts to provide engaging feedback.
