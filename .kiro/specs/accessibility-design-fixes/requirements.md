# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensively addressing accessibility and design issues throughout the fitness tracking application. The goal is to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, improve visual design consistency, fix responsive design problems, and create an inclusive user experience that works for all users regardless of their abilities or devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and proper ARIA labels, so that I can use all features of the fitness tracking app independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all interactive elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts and tab navigation
3. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN all text SHALL maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
4. IF images are present THEN they SHALL have descriptive alt text or be marked as decorative
5. WHEN form errors occur THEN they SHALL be announced to screen readers and clearly associated with form fields

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want customizable font sizes, high contrast themes, and clear visual hierarchy, so that I can read and interact with the application comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I adjust font size preferences THEN all text SHALL scale proportionally while maintaining layout integrity
2. WHEN I enable high contrast mode THEN the interface SHALL switch to high contrast colors with proper contrast ratios
3. WHEN viewing any page THEN heading structure SHALL follow proper hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) for screen reader navigation
4. IF color is used to convey information THEN additional visual indicators SHALL be provided (icons, patterns, text)
5. WHEN focus moves between elements THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible with 3px minimum outline

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work seamlessly across all device sizes with touch-friendly interactions, so that I can track my workouts effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on mobile devices THEN all touch targets SHALL be minimum 44px x 44px
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately without horizontal scrolling
3. WHEN rotating device orientation THEN content SHALL reflow properly and remain accessible
4. IF gestures are used THEN alternative interaction methods SHALL be provided for users who cannot perform gestures
5. WHEN using the app on small screens THEN critical functionality SHALL remain visible and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual design with proper spacing, typography, and color usage throughout the application, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any component THEN spacing SHALL follow consistent design token values (8px grid system)
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN typography SHALL use consistent font families, sizes, and line heights from design system
3. WHEN colors are used THEN they SHALL come from a defined color palette with documented usage guidelines
4. IF interactive elements exist THEN they SHALL have consistent hover, focus, and active states
5. WHEN components are reused THEN they SHALL maintain visual consistency across different contexts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive accessibility testing tools and documentation, so that I can maintain accessibility standards as the application evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN automated accessibility tests SHALL be included in the test suite
2. WHEN building components THEN accessibility guidelines SHALL be documented and enforced
3. WHEN code is committed THEN accessibility linting rules SHALL prevent common accessibility violations
4. IF accessibility issues are found THEN clear remediation steps SHALL be provided
5. WHEN new features are added THEN accessibility review SHALL be part of the development process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with motor impairments, I want the application to support various input methods and provide sufficient time for interactions, so that I can use the app at my own pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with timed elements THEN users SHALL be able to extend or disable time limits
2. WHEN using drag and drop functionality THEN alternative keyboard-based methods SHALL be available
3. WHEN clicking small targets THEN click areas SHALL be sufficiently large (minimum 44px x 44px)
4. IF auto-playing content exists THEN users SHALL be able to pause, stop, or control it
5. WHEN forms have validation THEN users SHALL have sufficient time to correct errors without losing data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want error messages and feedback to be clear, helpful, and accessible, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN messages SHALL be descriptive and provide clear next steps
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN errors SHALL be associated with specific fields and announced to screen readers
3. WHEN success actions complete THEN confirmation messages SHALL be provided in multiple formats (visual, audio)
4. IF loading states exist THEN progress indicators SHALL be accessible and informative
5. WHEN notifications appear THEN they SHALL not interfere with user tasks and be dismissible

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform well and remain responsive during interactions, so that accessibility features work smoothly without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN page load times SHALL not exceed 3 seconds for accessibility tree construction
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN focus changes SHALL occur within 100ms
3. WHEN animations play THEN users SHALL be able to disable them via system preferences or app settings
4. IF heavy computations occur THEN they SHALL not block accessibility API responses
5. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN the app SHALL remain responsive and not cause timeouts
