# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the existing mobile-first fitness tracking application to provide an optimal desktop experience with an AI chat-driven interface. The desktop layout will feature a split-screen design where the main application UI occupies the left side and an AI chat interface occupies the right side, allowing users to control and interact with the entire application through conversational AI while maintaining visual access to the app's interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the application to display in a split-screen layout with the main app on the left and AI chat on the right, so that I can control the application through AI while maintaining visual context of the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on screens wider than 1024px THEN the layout SHALL split into two main sections with app UI on the left and chat interface on the right
2. WHEN the split-screen layout is active THEN the app UI SHALL occupy approximately 60-70% of the screen width and chat SHALL occupy 30-40%
3. WHEN the screen width is between 768px and 1024px THEN the layout SHALL provide a toggle to switch between app view and chat view
4. IF the screen width is less than 768px THEN the layout SHALL remain mobile-first with chat accessible via overlay or separate screen
5. WHEN the split-screen is displayed THEN both sections SHALL be clearly delineated with appropriate visual separation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the AI chat interface to be prominently displayed and optimized for controlling the application, so that I can efficiently manage my fitness tracking through conversational commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface is displayed on desktop THEN it SHALL have a dedicated panel with clear input area and conversation history
2. WHEN I send commands through chat THEN the main app UI SHALL update in real-time to reflect the AI's actions
3. WHEN the AI performs actions THEN visual indicators SHALL highlight the affected areas in the main app UI
4. IF the AI needs to display data or results THEN they SHALL be visible in both the chat and reflected in the main app interface
5. WHEN using the chat interface THEN it SHALL support rich formatting for displaying workout data, progress, and other fitness information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the main app UI to efficiently utilize the left portion of the screen with optimized layouts, so that I can view comprehensive fitness information while the AI chat remains accessible on the right.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main app UI is displayed in the left panel THEN workout lists SHALL be displayed in a compact grid layout optimized for the reduced width
2. WHEN viewing workout details in the left panel THEN information SHALL be organized vertically with clear sections and appropriate spacing
3. WHEN displaying charts or progress data THEN visualizations SHALL be sized to fit the left panel width while remaining readable
4. IF the left panel becomes too narrow THEN content SHALL stack vertically with maintained readability
5. WHEN the AI chat references specific data THEN the corresponding elements in the left panel SHALL be highlighted or emphasized

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want to interact with forms and data entry primarily through the AI chat interface, so that I can create and edit workouts conversationally while seeing the results in the main app UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating workouts through chat THEN the AI SHALL guide me through the process conversationally and update the main UI in real-time
2. WHEN editing existing workouts via chat THEN the current workout data SHALL be displayed in the left panel while I make changes through conversation
3. WHEN the AI requests specific information THEN it SHALL provide clear prompts and accept natural language responses
4. IF traditional forms are still needed THEN they SHALL be optimized for the left panel width and integrate with the chat experience
5. WHEN data entry is completed through chat THEN confirmation SHALL be shown in both the chat and main UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want the application to maintain visual consistency and branding while adapting to desktop layouts, so that the experience feels cohesive across all device types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application on desktop THEN the color scheme and typography SHALL remain consistent with mobile
2. WHEN layouts adapt to desktop THEN spacing and proportions SHALL maintain visual harmony
3. WHEN interactive elements are resized THEN they SHALL maintain the same visual style and branding
4. IF new desktop-specific UI elements are introduced THEN they SHALL follow the existing design system
5. WHEN transitioning between mobile and desktop views THEN the user experience SHALL feel seamless and familiar
