08:33:13.865 npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

08:33:15.655 npm warn deprecated @types/handlebars@4.1.0: This is a stub types definition. handlebars provides its own type definitions, so you do not need this installed.
08:33:18.499 npm warn deprecated three-mesh-bvh@0.7.8: Deprecated due to three.js version incompatibility. Please use v0.8.0, instead.
